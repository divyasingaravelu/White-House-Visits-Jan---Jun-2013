#Week 1:
#White House Most Visited
#Who is being visited the most at the White House. The following is our code and analysis.

#Load whitehouse visits csv file (whitehouse-waves-2013_6.csv) and call it “visits”.
#as.is =”TRUE” will take the data as it is.
visits = read.csv("whitehouse-waves-2013_6.csv", as.is=TRUE)

#Create a new field called “visiteefullname” by combining the fields “visits$visitee_namelast” and “visitee_namelast”

visits$visiteefullname <- paste(visits$visitee_namefirst, visits$visitee_namelast, sep=" ")

#Convert visiteefullname to lowercase and Unicode
visits$visiteefullname = tolower(iconv(visits$visiteefullname, to="UTF-8"))

#Create a new field called “visitorfullname” by combining the fields “visits$NAMEFIRST” and “visitee_NAMELAST”

visits$visitorfullname <- paste(visits$NAMEFIRST, visits$NAMELAST, sep=" ")

#Convert visitorfullname to lowercase and Unicode
visits$visitorfullname = tolower(iconv(visits$visitorfullname, to="UTF-8"))

#Create a new dataframe called visitee to store visitee information

               1169                1305 

Observation: The visitees with the most number of visitors in January 2013 was the first couple (1305 visitors), followed by Kyle Lierman (Public Engagement Liaison, 1169 visitors).  In fourth place, we see a “blank” (987 visitors). From our “Nullvisitee” dataframe, we observed that the “Description” field for the “black” visitees have been filled in events. In fifth place, we have Victoria McCullough (Organizing for Action, 592 visitors)

Hypotheses: January 2013 seemed like a very social month at the White House, especially owing the following reasons:
-	Visitors visiting the first couple together would mostly do so for social reasons than for discussing state affairs. Because for the latter, they may have just visit the President.
-	The White House publicity liaison, Kyle Lierman, was a busy man in January 2013, and was the second most visited this month
-	The “blank” visitee names, from previous analysis revealed that they signified social gatherings like coffee meeting and state receptions.
